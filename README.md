# Purchase List App
A responsive Purchase List application built with React and TypeScript that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.


## Overview
The Purchase List App is a simple tool for viewing purchases whether you're on your mobile device or desktop. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

1. **src/:** Contains the source code of the application.
2. **/common/:**
    - **components**: React shared/flexible UI components to be used across the app.
    - **layout**: Common layout that could eventually include shared page elements such as header, sidebar, footer, etc
    - **types**: Common types used across the app
    - **utils**: Common utils used across the app.
   
3.**/screens:**  Top-level screens or pages of the app.
      - **/purchases.tsx:** Renders either the purchases' table or list based on the screen (mobile vs desktop)

4.**assets/:** Assets like logos and images used in the project.

5.**package.json:** Node.js package configuration.

6.**tsconfig.json:** TypeScript configuration.

### Things To-do:
- Make the app load in chunks to avoid loading both desktop and mobile components for any screen.
- Define design system where we can unify colors and spacing used across the app for consistency.
- Better error handling for data fetching
- Use <ErrorBoundry/> to catch errors and handle them gracefully.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
